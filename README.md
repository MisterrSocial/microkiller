simple python script to continuously kill annoying background tasks that microsoft windows runs while full screen gaming.  list is easily edited at the top of the file to customize it for your needs.  if you are getting errors and processes are not being killed, try running the script in admin mode.  

usage:

* navigate to the folder of the microkiller.py file, right click, select 'open terminal here' (or open a terminal in admin mode and cd to the directory)
* type "python microkller.py" (minus the quotes of course) and press enter.

if you get an error you likely either do not have python installed or do not have the python path set.  you can install python from the terminal using "winget install python".  you may also need to install the dependent library "psutils" using "pip install psutils"

sorry if my repo is a bit rough this is my first code publish in almost 20 years lol.
